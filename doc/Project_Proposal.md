## Project Summary

RaceRewind is a comprehensive web application aimed at Formula 1 (F1) enthusiasts. It provides unique insights and alternative scenarios based on historical and recent F1 data, allowing users to explore "what-if" situations and in-depth analyses. The application will offer recalculations of past championships with current scoring systems, analyze driver performance through sector times, and track the evolution of pit stop efficiency. Through advanced data analysis techniques, RaceRewind will help F1 fans gain a deeper understanding of the sport's complexities beyond traditional statistics.


## Project Description

RaceRewind aims to bridge the gap between surface-level F1 statistics and deeper, more nuanced analysis that passionate fans crave. It will allow users to interact with F1 data to visualize alternative championship outcomes, theoretical race times, and analyze driver consistency across qualifying and race performances. Additionally, the platform will track trends in pit stop efficiency and help users assess the correlation between qualifying and race results.

The core features of the application include:

1. Historical Championship Recalculation
2. Theoretical Ideal Race Time Calculator
3. Qualifying Driver Consistency Index
4. Pit Stop Evolution Tracker
5. Qualifying vs. Race Performance Correlation
6. Performance Outlier Identifier

These features aim to deliver an interactive and educational experience for both long-time fans and newcomers to Formula 1 racing.

### Usefulness of the Application

RaceRewind enhances the F1 fan experience by offering:

- Hypothetical race scenarios using current points systems for past championships.
- Detailed performance analyses that go beyond basic race results.
- Insights into overlooked aspects like pit stop efficiency and driver consistency in qualifying sessions.
- An interactive, customizable tool for both new and seasoned fans to explore Formula 1 data and engage in deeper analysis.

### Data Sources

We will leverage two primary data sources:

1. **Race Results Data**:
   - Captures race results for each Grand Prix event with details like driver positions, lap times, constructors, tire manufacturers, and penalties.

2. **Sector Timing Data**:
   - Includes sector timings for each driver from 2018 to 2019, allowing further analysis of their performance.

Both datasets are real and reliable, providing accurate historical and recent F1 information for our application.

### Functionality Description

The application will provide multiple data-driven features, including:

- Recalculating historical championships using different scoring systems.
- Analyzing theoretical best lap times based on fastest sector times.
- Measuring driver consistency during qualifying.
- Visualizing the evolution of pit stop times.
- Correlating qualifying positions with final race outcomes.
- Identifying significant outlier performances.

### Low-Fidelity UI Mockup

The UI will feature a dashboard that presents key analysis tools in an intuitive format. Users can select various options (e.g., seasons, drivers, teams) and visualize data through interactive charts and graphs. The UI will prioritize ease of navigation and data exploration for fans.

## Project Work Distribution

The team members will contribute to the project in the following areas:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing** (Jay, Aarush):
   - Collect and clean race results, sector timing, and pit stop data.
   - Set up the database for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
   
2. **Backend Systems Development** (Yash, Aarush, Neel, Jay):
   - Develop APIs, implement championship recalculation, and process data for the frontend.
   - Optimize performance for handling large datasets and algorithms like lap time calculators and pit stop analysis.
   
3. **Frontend Development** (Neel):
   - Design and implement the user-facing components of the application, including interactive visualizations.
   
4. **System Integration and Testing** (Yash):
   - Ensure seamless integration of backend and frontend systems, and conduct unit and performance testing.
