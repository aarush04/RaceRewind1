## Project Summary 

This project aims to develop a comprehensive web application for Formula 1 enthusiasts, offering unique insights and alternative scenarios based on historical and recent F1 data. The application, called RaceRewind, will allow users to explore how past championships might have unfolded under current scoring systems, analyze driver performances based on sector times, and track the evolution of pit stop efficiency. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, this platform will provide F1 fans with a deeper understanding of the sport's nuances and "what-if" scenarios that go beyond traditional race statistics.
RaceRewind will feature a user-friendly interface that enables fans to interact with complex data sets in an intuitive manner. Users will be able to visualize historical championship recalculations, compare theoretical race times with actual results, and assess driver consistency in qualifying sessions. Additionally, the application will offer insights into the correlation between qualifying and race performance, and identify standout performances across different seasons. By combining these features, RaceRewind aims to become an indispensable tool for passionate F1 fans seeking to deepen their engagement with the sport through data-driven analysis and exploration.
